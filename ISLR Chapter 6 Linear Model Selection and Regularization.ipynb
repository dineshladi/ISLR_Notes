    "## Introduction\n",
    "Simple linear models can be improved by replacing plain least squares fitting with some alternative fitting procedures. Alternative fitting procedures can yield better prediction accuracy and model interpretability. \n",
    "* **Prediction Accuracy**: If n >> p, least squares estimate tends to have low variance and perform well on test data. However, if n is not much larger than p, there can be a lot of variability in the least squares fit resulting in overfitting. And if p > n, the variance is infinite and method cannot be used. By shrinking the estimated cofficients, we can substantially reduce variance at the cost of negligible increase in bias. \n",
    "* **Model Interpretability**: Irrelevant variables leads to unncessary complexity in the resulting model. By removing these varibales, we can obtain a model that is more easily interpreted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to using least squared to fit:\n",
    "1. Subset Selection: Identify subset of p predictors that we believe to be related to the response. We fit the model using those reduced set of variables\n",
    "2. Shrinkage: Estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero relative to the least squares estimates. The shrinkage has effect of reducing variance.\n",
    "3. Dimension Reduction: Projectng p predictors into M dimensional subspace where M < p. Those M projections are used as predictors to fit models by least squares. "

The ridge regression coefficient estimates can change substantially when multiplying a given predictor by a constant. It is best to apply ridge regression after\n",

    "PCA is a technique for reducing the dimension of a nxp data matrix X. The first principal component direction of the data is that along which the observations vary the most. The second principal component Z2 is a linear combination of the variables that is uncorrelated with Z1,and has largest variance subject to this constraint.\n",

    "The principal components regression (PCR) approach involves constructing principal the firstM principal components,Z1, . . ., ZM, and then using these compo components regression nents as the predictors in a linear regression model that is fi using least squares. The key idea is that often a small number of principal components suffice to explain most of the variability in the data, as well as the relationship with the response. As more principal components are used in the regression model, the bias decreases, but the variance increases. PCR is more closely related to ridge regression than to the lasso. When performing PCR, we generally recommend standardizing each predictor, prior to generating the principal components. This standardization ensures that all variables are on the same scale. "

    "There is no guarantee that the directions that best explain the predictors will also be the best directions to use for predicting the response. Unlike PCR, PLS identifies these new features in a supervised wayâ€”that is, it makes use of the response Y in order to identify new features that not only approximate the old features well, but also that are related to the response. PLS approach attempts to find directions that help explain both the response and the predictors. PLS places the highest weight on the variables that are most strongly related to the response. \n",
    "\n",
    " To identify the second PLS direction we first adjust each of the variables for Z1, by regressing each variable on Z1 and taking residuals. These resid uals can be interpreted as the remaining information that has not been explained by the first PLS direction. We then compute Z2 using this or thogonalized data in exactly the same fashion as Z1 was computed based on the original data."
